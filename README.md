is a deck-building game set in the Marvel Comics universe.

 

To set up the game, players choose a number of hero decks from the likes of Spider-man, Hulk,
 Cyclops, or Wolverine, to name a few. Shuffle them together (since players use only a 
 handful of hero decks out of the fifteen included) allowing the hero deck to vary widely in 
 terms of what's available.

 

Players then choose a mastermind villain (Magneto, Loki, Dr. Doom, etc.) and stack that 
particular villain's attack cards underneath it. Next, modify the villain deck as needed 
based on that villain's particular scheme.

 

Over the course of the game, players will recruit powerful hero cards to add to their deck in
order to build a stronger and more resourceful deck.

 

Players need to build both their recruitment powers (to enlist more heroes) and their
fighting ability (to combat the villains who keep popping up to cause trouble).

 

Players recruit heroes from an array of six cards, with empty slots refilled as needed. At
the start of a player's turn, he reveals a villain and adds it to the row of villains. This
row has a limited number of spaces, and if it fills up, the earliest villain to arrive
escapes, possibly punishing the heroes in some way.

 

Some villains also take an action when showing up for the first time, such as kidnapping an
innocent bystander. The villain deck also contains "master strike" cards, and whenever one of
these shows up, the mastermind villain (controlled by the game) takes a bonus action.

 

As players fight and defeat villains, they collect those cards, which will be worth points at
game's end. Players can also fight the mastermind; if a player has enough fighting power, he
claims one of the attack cards beneath the mastermind, which has a particular effect on the
game.

 

If all of these cards are claimed, the game ends and players tally their points to see who
wins. If the mastermind completes his scheme, however  having a certain number of villains
escape, for example, or imposing a certain number of wounds on the heroes  then the players
all lose.
